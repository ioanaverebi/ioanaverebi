# PolyPod 

*PolyPod* is a configurable survey application: [pod.polypoly.eu](https://pod.polypoly.eu/index.html). It handles the survey type dynamically and also comes with internationalization bundled within.
The mobile application was developed with React Native and uses Pharo as a backend. A large emphasis was made on security and making sure that the data is completely anonymized.
